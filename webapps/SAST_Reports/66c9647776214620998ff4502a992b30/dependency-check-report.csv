The jQuery(strInput) function does not differentiate selectors from HTML in a reliable fashion. In vulnerable versions, jQuery determined whether the input was HTML by looking for the '<' character anywhere in the string, giving attackers more flexibility when attempting to construct a malicious payload. In fixed versions, jQuery only deems the input to be HTML if it explicitly starts with the '<' character, limiting exploitability only to attackers who can control the beginning of a string, which is far less common.",NVD,MEDIUM,4.3,/AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N,MEDIUM,6.1,CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N,HIGHEST,3
