"Blind SQL Injection (timing attack)","Due to the requirement for dynamic content of today's web applications, many
rely on a database backend to store data that will be called upon and processed
by the web application (or other programs).
Web applications retrieve data from the database by using Structured Query Language
(SQL) queries.

To meet demands of many developers, database servers (such as MSSQL, MySQL,
Oracle etc.) have additional built-in functionality that can allow extensive
control of the database and interaction with the host operating system itself.

An SQL injection occurs when a value originating from the client's request is used
within a SQL query without prior sanitisation. This could allow cyber-criminals
to execute arbitrary SQL code and steal data or use the additional functionality
of the database server to take control of more server components.

The successful exploitation of a SQL injection can be devastating to an
organisation and is one of the most commonly exploited web application vulnerabilities.

This injection was detected as SCNR::Engine was able to inject specific SQL queries,
that if vulnerable, result in the responses for each request being delayed before
being sent by the server.
This is known as a time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability.","The only proven method to prevent against SQL injection attacks while still
maintaining full application functionality is to use parameterized queries
(also known as prepared statements).
When utilising this method of querying the database, any value supplied by the
client will be handled as a string value rather than part of the SQL query.

Additionally, when utilising parameterized queries, the database engine will
automatically check to make sure the string being used matches that of the column.
For example, the database engine will check that the user supplied input is an
integer if the database column is configured to contain integers.","","high","Tasos ""Zapotek"" Laskos <tasos.laskos@gmail.com>","0.3.3","sql_injection_timing","","89","2817509067","","","SCNR::Engine::Element::Form","form","http://172.31.3.192:8081/forgotPassword.php","http://172.31.3.192:8081/userAccount.php","<form action=""userAccount.php"" method=""post"">

"Unencrypted password form","The HTTP protocol by itself is clear text, meaning that any data that is
transmitted via HTTP can be captured and the contents viewed.

To keep data private, and prevent it from being intercepted, HTTP is often
tunnelled through either Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), or Transport Layer Security
(TLS).
When either of these encryption standards are used it is referred to as HTTPS.

Cyber-criminals will often attempt to compromise credentials passed from the
client to the server using HTTP.
This can be conducted via various different Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM) attacks or
through network packet captures.

SCNR::Engine discovered that the affected page contains a `password` input, however,
the value of the field is not sent to the server utilising HTTPS. Therefore it
is possible that any submitted credential may become compromised.","The affected site should be secured utilising the latest and most secure encryption
protocols.
These include SSL version 3.0 and TLS version 1.2. While TLS 1.2 is the latest
and the most preferred protocol, not all browsers will support this encryption
method. Therefore, the more common SSL is included. Older protocols such as SSL
version 2, and weak ciphers (< 128 bit) should also be disabled.","","medium","Tasos ""Zapotek"" Laskos <tasos.laskos@gmail.com>","0.2.2","unencrypted_password_forms","","319","2533841055","","","SCNR::Engine::Element::Form","form","http://172.31.3.192:8081/login.php","http://172.31.3.192:8081/login.php","<form action="""" method=""post"">

"Password field with auto-complete","In typical form-based web applications, it is common practice for developers to
allow `autocomplete` within the HTML form to improve the usability of the page.
With `autocomplete` enabled (default), the browser is allowed to cache previously
entered form values.

For legitimate purposes, this allows the user to quickly re-enter the same data
when completing the form multiple times.

When `autocomplete` is enabled on either/both the username and password fields,
this could allow a cyber-criminal with access to the victim's computer the ability
to have the victim's credentials automatically entered as the cyber-criminal
visits the affected page.

SCNR::Engine has discovered that the affected page contains a form containing a
password field that has not disabled `autocomplete`.","The `autocomplete` value can be configured in two different locations.

The first and most secure location is to disable the `autocomplete` attribute on
the `<form>` HTML tag. This will disable `autocomplete` for all inputs within that form.
An example of disabling `autocomplete` within the form tag is `<form autocomplete=off>`.

The second slightly less desirable option is to disable the `autocomplete` attribute
for a specific `<input>` HTML tag.
While this may be the less desired solution from a security perspective, it may
be preferred method for usability reasons, depending on size of the form.
An example of disabling the `autocomplete` attribute within a password input tag
is `<input type=password autocomplete=off>`.","","low","Tasos ""Zapotek"" Laskos <tasos.laskos@gmail.com>","0.3.1","password_autocomplete","","1978937363","","SCNR::Engine::Element::Form","form","http://172.31.3.192:8081/login.php","http://172.31.3.192:8081/login.php","<form action="""" method=""post"">

"Common sensitive file","Web applications are often made up of multiple files and directories.

It is possible that over time some files may become unreferenced (unused)
by the web application and forgotten about by the administrator/developer.
Because web applications are built using common frameworks, they contain common
files that can be discovered (independent of server).

During the initial recon stages of an attack, cyber-criminals will attempt to
locate unreferenced files in the hope that the file will assist in further
compromise of the web application.
To achieve this they will make thousands of requests using word lists containing
common filenames.
The response headers from the server will then indicate if the file exists.

SCNR::Engine also contains a list of common file names which it will attempt to access.","If files are unreferenced then they should be removed from the web root
and/or the application directory.

Preventing access without authentication may also be an option and can stop a
client from being able to view the contents of a file, however it is still likely
that the directory structure will be able to be discovered.

not a recommended option.","","low","Tasos ""Zapotek"" Laskos <tasos.laskos@gmail.com>","0.2.4","common_files","","3006415440","","","SCNR::Engine::Element::Server","server","http://172.31.3.192:8081/config.php","http://172.31.3.192:8081/config.php","","","","get","","","","GET /config.php HTTP/1.1

"HttpOnly cookie","HTTP by itself is a stateless protocol. Therefore the server is unable to determine
which requests are performed by which client, and which clients are authenticated
or unauthenticated.

The use of HTTP cookies within the headers, allows a web server to identify each
individual client and can therefore determine which clients hold valid
authentication, from those that do not. These are known as session cookies.

When a cookie is set by the server (sent the header of an HTTP response) there
are several flags that can be set to configure the properties of the cookie and
how it is to be handled by the browser.

The `HttpOnly` flag assists in the prevention of client side-scripts (such as
JavaScript) accessing and using the cookie.

This can help prevent XSS attacks targeting the cookies holding the client's
session token (setting the `HttpOnly` flag does not prevent, nor safeguard against
XSS vulnerabilities themselves).","The initial step to remedy this would be to determine whether any client-side
scripts (such as JavaScript) need to access the cookie and if not, set the
`HttpOnly` flag.

Additionally, it should be noted that some older browsers are not compatible with
the `HttpOnly` flag, and therefore setting this flag will not protect those clients
against this form of attack.","","informational","Tasos ""Zapotek"" Laskos <tasos.laskos@gmail.com>","0.1.5","http_only_cookies","","200","4206811426","","","SCNR::Engine::Element::Cookie","cookie","http://172.31.3.192:8081/c.php","http://172.31.3.192:8081/c.php","PHPSESSID=f91fa80fde5a09176f4c5b394dbc0098; path=/","","","","","","","","1<br/>","post","","","","POST /c.php HTTP/1.1
