"Private IP address disclosure","Private, or non-routable, IP addresses are generally used within a home or
company network and are typically unknown to anyone outside of that network.

Cyber-criminals will attempt to identify the private IP address range being used
by their victim, to aid in collecting further information that could then lead
to a possible compromise.

Arachni discovered that the affected page returned a RFC 1918 compliant private
IP address and therefore could be revealing sensitive information.

_This finding typically requires manual verification to ensure the context is
correct, as any private IP address within the HTML body will trigger it.","Identifying the context in which the affected page displays a Private IP
address is necessary.

If the page is publicly accessible and displays the Private IP of the affected
server (or supporting infrastructure), then measures should be put in place to
ensure that the IP address is removed from any response.","","low","Tasos Laskos <tasos.laskos@arachni-scanner.com>","0.3","private_ip","","200","289382663","","","Arachni::Element::Body","body","http://172.31.3.192/dvwa/index.php","http://172.31.3.192/dvwa/index.php","","","<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN"">

"Allowed HTTP methods","There are a number of HTTP methods that can be used on a webserver (`OPTIONS`,
`HEAD`, `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` etc.).  Each of these methods perform a
different function and each have an associated level of risk when their use is
permitted on the webserver.

A client can use the `OPTIONS` method within a request to query a server to
determine which methods are allowed.

Cyber-criminals will almost always perform this simple test as it will give a
very quick indication of any high-risk methods being permitted by the server.

Arachni discovered that several methods are supported by the server.","It is recommended that a whitelisting approach be taken to explicitly permit the
HTTP methods required by the application and block all others.

Typically the only HTTP methods required for most applications are `GET` and
`POST`. All other methods perform actions that are rarely required or perform
actions that are inherently risky.

These risky methods (such as `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc) should be protected by strict
limitations, such as ensuring that the channel is secure (SSL/TLS enabled) and
only authorised and trusted clients are permitted to use them.","","informational","Tasos ""Zapotek"" Laskos <tasos.laskos@arachni-scanner.com>","0.2","allowed_methods","","3943212890","","","Arachni::Element::Server","server","http://172.31.3.192/dvwa/index.php","http://172.31.3.192/dvwa/index.php","","","","options","","","","OPTIONS /dvwa/index.php HTTP/1.1
