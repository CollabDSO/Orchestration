[+] 4 issues were detected.

[+] [1] Private IP address disclosure (Trusted)
[~] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[~] Digest:     3388727370
[~] Severity:   Low
[~] Description: 
[~] 
Private, or non-routable, IP addresses are generally used within a home or
company network and are typically unknown to anyone outside of that network.

Cyber-criminals will attempt to identify the private IP address range being used
by their victim, to aid in collecting further information that could then lead
to a possible compromise.

SCNR::Engine discovered that the affected page returned a RFC 1918 compliant private
IP address and therefore could be revealing sensitive information.

_This finding typically requires manual verification to ensure the context is
correct, as any private IP address within the HTML body will trigger it.

[+] [2] Allowed HTTP methods (Trusted)
[~] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[~] Digest:     2379677628
[~] Severity:   Informational
[~] Description: 
[~] 
There are a number of HTTP methods that can be used on a webserver (`OPTIONS`,
`HEAD`, `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` etc.).  Each of these methods perform a
different function and each have an associated level of risk when their use is
permitted on the webserver.

A client can use the `OPTIONS` method within a request to query a server to
determine which methods are allowed.

Cyber-criminals will almost always perform this simple test as it will give a
very quick indication of any high-risk methods being permitted by the server.

SCNR::Engine discovered that several methods are supported by the server.

[+] [3] Interesting response (Trusted)
[~] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[~] Digest:     41863912
[~] Severity:   Informational
[~] Description: 
[~] 
The server responded with a non 200 (OK) nor 404 (Not Found) status code.
This is a non-issue, however exotic HTTP response status codes can provide useful
insights into the behavior of the web application and assist with the penetration test.
