"Common directory","Web applications are often made up of multiple files and directories.

It is possible that over time some directories may become unreferenced (unused)
by the web application and forgotten about by the administrator/developer.
Because web applications are built using common frameworks, they contain common
directories that can be discovered (independent of server).

During the initial recon stages of an attack, cyber-criminals will attempt to
locate unreferenced directories in the hope that the directory will assist in further
compromise of the web application.
To achieve this they will make thousands of requests using word lists containing
common names.
The response headers from the server will then indicate if the directory exists.

SCNR::Engine also contains a list of common directory names which it will attempt to access.","If directories are unreferenced then they should be removed from the web root
and/or the application directory.

Preventing access without authentication may also be an option and can stop a
client from being able to view the contents of a file, however it is still likely
that the directory structure will be able to be discovered.

Using obscure directory names is implementing security through obscurity and is
not a recommended option.","","medium","Tasos ""Zapotek"" Laskos <tasos.laskos@gmail.com>","0.2.3","common_directories","","538","2941428724","","","SCNR::Engine::Element::Server","server","http://172.31.3.192/DVWA/.git/objects/info/","http://172.31.3.192/DVWA/.git/objects/info/","","","<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN"">

directories that can be discovered (independent of server).

During the initial recon stages of an attack, cyber-criminals will attempt to
locate unreferenced directories in the hope that the directory will assist in further
compromise of the web application.
To achieve this they will make thousands of requests using word lists containing
common names.
The response headers from the server will then indicate if the directory exists.

SCNR::Engine also contains a list of common directory names which it will attempt to access.","If directories are unreferenced then they should be removed from the web root
and/or the application directory.

Preventing access without authentication may also be an option and can stop a
client from being able to view the contents of a file, however it is still likely
that the directory structure will be able to be discovered.

Using obscure directory names is implementing security through obscurity and is
not a recommended option.","","medium","Tasos ""Zapotek"" Laskos <tasos.laskos@gmail.com>","0.2.3","common_directories","","538","531415255","","","SCNR::Engine::Element::Server","server","http://172.31.3.192/DVWA/tests/","http://172.31.3.192/DVWA/tests/","","","<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN"">

"Unencrypted password form","The HTTP protocol by itself is clear text, meaning that any data that is
transmitted via HTTP can be captured and the contents viewed.

To keep data private, and prevent it from being intercepted, HTTP is often
tunnelled through either Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), or Transport Layer Security
(TLS).
When either of these encryption standards are used it is referred to as HTTPS.

Cyber-criminals will often attempt to compromise credentials passed from the
client to the server using HTTP.
This can be conducted via various different Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM) attacks or
through network packet captures.

SCNR::Engine discovered that the affected page contains a `password` input, however,
the value of the field is not sent to the server utilising HTTPS. Therefore it
is possible that any submitted credential may become compromised.","The affected site should be secured utilising the latest and most secure encryption
protocols.
These include SSL version 3.0 and TLS version 1.2. While TLS 1.2 is the latest
and the most preferred protocol, not all browsers will support this encryption
method. Therefore, the more common SSL is included. Older protocols such as SSL
version 2, and weak ciphers (< 128 bit) should also be disabled.","","medium","Tasos ""Zapotek"" Laskos <tasos.laskos@gmail.com>","0.2.2","unencrypted_password_forms","","319","1019822465","","","SCNR::Engine::Element::Form","form","http://172.31.3.192/DVWA/login.php","http://172.31.3.192/DVWA/login.php","<form action=""login.php"" method=""post"">

"HttpOnly cookie","HTTP by itself is a stateless protocol. Therefore the server is unable to determine
which requests are performed by which client, and which clients are authenticated
or unauthenticated.

The use of HTTP cookies within the headers, allows a web server to identify each
individual client and can therefore determine which clients hold valid
authentication, from those that do not. These are known as session cookies.

When a cookie is set by the server (sent the header of an HTTP response) there
are several flags that can be set to configure the properties of the cookie and
how it is to be handled by the browser.

The `HttpOnly` flag assists in the prevention of client side-scripts (such as
JavaScript) accessing and using the cookie.

This can help prevent XSS attacks targeting the cookies holding the client's
session token (setting the `HttpOnly` flag does not prevent, nor safeguard against
XSS vulnerabilities themselves).","The initial step to remedy this would be to determine whether any client-side
scripts (such as JavaScript) need to access the cookie and if not, set the
`HttpOnly` flag.

Additionally, it should be noted that some older browsers are not compatible with
the `HttpOnly` flag, and therefore setting this flag will not protect those clients
against this form of attack.","","informational","Tasos ""Zapotek"" Laskos <tasos.laskos@gmail.com>","0.1.5","http_only_cookies","","200","2581423736","","","SCNR::Engine::Element::Cookie","cookie","http://172.31.3.192/DVWA/","http://172.31.3.192/DVWA/","PHPSESSID=sqolqn2bj8drd8l262n3hv4cb0; path=/","","","","","","","","","get","","","","GET /DVWA/ HTTP/1.1
