[+] 10 issues were detected.

[+] [1] Blind SQL Injection (timing attack) (Trusted)
[~] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[~] Digest:     2817509067
[~] Severity:   High
[~] Description: 
[~] 
Due to the requirement for dynamic content of today's web applications, many
rely on a database backend to store data that will be called upon and processed
by the web application (or other programs).
Web applications retrieve data from the database by using Structured Query Language
(SQL) queries.

To meet demands of many developers, database servers (such as MSSQL, MySQL,
Oracle etc.) have additional built-in functionality that can allow extensive
control of the database and interaction with the host operating system itself.

An SQL injection occurs when a value originating from the client's request is used
within a SQL query without prior sanitisation. This could allow cyber-criminals
to execute arbitrary SQL code and steal data or use the additional functionality
of the database server to take control of more server components.

The successful exploitation of a SQL injection can be devastating to an
organisation and is one of the most commonly exploited web application vulnerabilities.

This injection was detected as SCNR::Engine was able to inject specific SQL queries,
that if vulnerable, result in the responses for each request being delayed before
being sent by the server.
This is known as a time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability.

Web applications retrieve data from the database by using Structured Query Language
(SQL) queries.

To meet demands of many developers, database servers (such as MSSQL, MySQL,
Oracle etc.) have additional built-in functionality that can allow extensive
control of the database and interaction with the host operating system itself.

An SQL injection occurs when a value originating from the client's request is used
within a SQL query without prior sanitisation. This could allow cyber-criminals
to execute arbitrary SQL code and steal data or use the additional functionality
of the database server to take control of more server components.

The successful exploitation of a SQL injection can be devastating to an
organisation and is one of the most commonly exploited web application vulnerabilities.

This injection was detected as SCNR::Engine was able to inject specific SQL queries,
that if vulnerable, result in the responses for each request being delayed before
being sent by the server.
This is known as a time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability.

[+] [3] Unencrypted password form (Trusted)
[~] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[~] Digest:     2533841055
[~] Severity:   Medium
[~] Description: 
[~] 
The HTTP protocol by itself is clear text, meaning that any data that is
transmitted via HTTP can be captured and the contents viewed.

To keep data private, and prevent it from being intercepted, HTTP is often
tunnelled through either Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), or Transport Layer Security
(TLS).
When either of these encryption standards are used it is referred to as HTTPS.

Cyber-criminals will often attempt to compromise credentials passed from the
client to the server using HTTP.
This can be conducted via various different Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM) attacks or
through network packet captures.

SCNR::Engine discovered that the affected page contains a `password` input, however,
the value of the field is not sent to the server utilising HTTPS. Therefore it
is possible that any submitted credential may become compromised.

[+] [4] Password field with auto-complete (Trusted)
[~] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[~] Digest:     1978937363
[~] Severity:   Low
[~] Description: 
[~] 
In typical form-based web applications, it is common practice for developers to
allow `autocomplete` within the HTML form to improve the usability of the page.
With `autocomplete` enabled (default), the browser is allowed to cache previously
entered form values.

For legitimate purposes, this allows the user to quickly re-enter the same data
when completing the form multiple times.

When `autocomplete` is enabled on either/both the username and password fields,
this could allow a cyber-criminal with access to the victim's computer the ability
to have the victim's credentials automatically entered as the cyber-criminal
visits the affected page.

SCNR::Engine has discovered that the affected page contains a form containing a
password field that has not disabled `autocomplete`.

[+] [5] Common sensitive file (Trusted)
[~] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[~] Digest:     3006415440
[~] Severity:   Low
[~] Description: 
[~] 
Web applications are often made up of multiple files and directories.

It is possible that over time some files may become unreferenced (unused)
by the web application and forgotten about by the administrator/developer.
Because web applications are built using common frameworks, they contain common
files that can be discovered (independent of server).

During the initial recon stages of an attack, cyber-criminals will attempt to
locate unreferenced files in the hope that the file will assist in further
compromise of the web application.
To achieve this they will make thousands of requests using word lists containing
common filenames.
The response headers from the server will then indicate if the file exists.

SCNR::Engine also contains a list of common file names which it will attempt to access.

[+] [6] Missing 'X-Frame-Options' header (Trusted)
[~] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[~] Digest:     1173186050
[~] Severity:   Low
[~] Description: 
[~] 
Clickjacking (User Interface redress attack, UI redress attack, UI redressing)
is a malicious technique of tricking a Web user into clicking on something different
from what the user perceives they are clicking on, thus potentially revealing
confidential information or taking control of their computer while clicking on
seemingly innocuous web pages.

The server didn't return an `X-Frame-Options` header which means that this website
could be at risk of a clickjacking attack.

The `X-Frame-Options` HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether or not
a browser should be allowed to render a page inside a frame or iframe. Sites can
use this to avoid clickjacking attacks, by ensuring that their content is not
embedded into other sites.

[+] [7] HttpOnly cookie (Trusted)
[~] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[~] Digest:     4206811426
[~] Severity:   Informational
[~] Description: 
[~] 
HTTP by itself is a stateless protocol. Therefore the server is unable to determine
which requests are performed by which client, and which clients are authenticated
or unauthenticated.

The use of HTTP cookies within the headers, allows a web server to identify each
individual client and can therefore determine which clients hold valid
authentication, from those that do not. These are known as session cookies.

When a cookie is set by the server (sent the header of an HTTP response) there
are several flags that can be set to configure the properties of the cookie and
how it is to be handled by the browser.

The `HttpOnly` flag assists in the prevention of client side-scripts (such as
JavaScript) accessing and using the cookie.

This can help prevent XSS attacks targeting the cookies holding the client's
session token (setting the `HttpOnly` flag does not prevent, nor safeguard against
XSS vulnerabilities themselves).
