InSpec Host+Container Profile Report </h3></b></left></p><style>table, th, td {font-family: arial, sans-serif;border: 1px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;}tr:nth-child(even) {background-color: #E8E6E5;}</style><table><tr bgcolor="#9FA68F"><th>ID</th><th>Title</th><th>Test Status</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>docker-4.1</td><td>Create a user for the container</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>Create a non-root user for the container in the Dockerfile for the container image.

  Rationale: It is a good practice to run the container as a non-root user, if possible. Though user namespace mapping is now available, if a user is already defined in the container image, the container is run as that user by default and specific user namespace remapping is not required.</td></tr><tr><td>docker-4.2</td><td>Use trusted base images for containers</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>Ensure that the container image is written either from scratch or is based on another established and trusted base image downloaded over a secure channel.

  Rationale: Official repositories are Docker images curated and optimized by the Docker community or the vendor. There could be other potentially unsafe public repositories. You should thus exercise a lot of caution when obtaining container images.</td></tr><tr><td>docker-4.5</td><td>Enable Content trust for Docker</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>Content trust is disabled by default. You should enable it.

  Rationale: Content trust provides the ability to use digital signatures for data sent to and received from remote Docker registries. These signatures allow client-side verification of the integrity and publisher of specific image tags. This ensures provenance of container images.</td></tr><tr><td>docker-4.6</td><td>Add HEALTHCHECK instruction to the container image</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>Add HEALTHCHECK instruction in your docker container images to perform the health check on running containers.

  Rationale: One of the important security triads is availability. Adding HEALTHCHECK instruction to your container image ensures that the docker engine periodically checks the running container instances against that instruction to ensure that the instances are still working. Based on the reported health status, the docker engine could then exit non-working containers and instantiate new ones.</td></tr><tr><td>docker-5.3</td><td>Restrict Linux Kernel Capabilities within containers</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>By default, Docker starts containers with a restricted set of Linux Kernel Capabilities. It means that any process may be granted the required capabilities instead of root access. Using Linux Kernel Capabilities, the processes do not have to run as root for almost all the specific areas where root privileges are usually needed.

  Rationale: Docker supports the addition and removal of capabilities, allowing use of a non-default profile. This may make Docker more secure through capability removal, or less secure through the addition of capabilities. It is thus recommended to remove all capabilities except those explicitly required for your container process.

  For example, capabilities such as below are usually not needed for container process: NET_ADMIN, SYS_ADMIN, SYS_MODULE</td></tr><tr><td>docker-5.5</td><td>Do not mount sensitive host system directories on containers</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>Sensitive host system directories such as '/, /boot, /dev, /etc, /lib, /proc, /sys, /usr' should not be allowed to be mounted as container volumes especially in read-write mode.

  Rationale: If sensitive directories are mounted in read-write mode, it would be possible to make changes to files within those sensitive directories. The changes might bring down security implications or unwarranted changes that could put the Docker host in compromised state.</td></tr><tr><td>docker-5.7</td><td>Do not map privileged ports within containers</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>The TCP/IP port numbers below 1024 are considered privileged ports. Normal users and processes are not allowed to use them for various security reasons. Docker allows a container port to be mapped to a privileged port.

  Rationale: By default, if the user does not specifically declare the container port to host port mapping, Docker automatically and correctly maps the container port to one available in 49153-65535 block on the host. But, Docker allows a container port to be mapped to a privileged port on the host if the user explicitly declared it. This is so because containers are executed with NET_BIND_SERVICE Linux kernel capability that does not restrict the privileged port mapping. The privileged ports receive and transmit various sensitive and privileged data. Allowing containers to use them can bring serious implications.</td></tr><tr><td>docker-5.10</td><td>Limit memory usage for container</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>By default, all containers on a Docker host share the resources equally. By using the resource management capabilities of Docker host, such as memory limit, you can control the amount of memory that a container may consume.

  Rationale: By default, container can use all of the memory on the host. You can use memory limit mechanism to prevent a denial of service arising from one container consuming all of the host’s resources such that other containers on the same host cannot perform their intended functions. Having no limit on memory can lead to issues where one container can easily make the whole system unstable and as a result unusable.</td></tr><tr><td>docker-5.11</td><td>Set container CPU priority appropriately</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>By default, all containers on a Docker host share the resources equally. By using the resource management capabilities of Docker host, such as CPU shares, you can control the host CPU resources that a container may consume.

  Rationale: By default, CPU time is divided between containers equally. If it is desired, to control the CPU time amongst the container instances, you can use CPU sharing feature. CPU sharing allows to prioritize one container over the other and forbids the lower priority container to claim CPU resources more often. This ensures that the high priority containers are served better.</td></tr><tr><td>docker-5.12</td><td>Mount container's root filesystem as read only</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>The container's root file system should be treated as a 'golden image' and any writes to the root filesystem should be avoided. You should explicitly define a container volume for writing.

  Rationale: You should not be writing data within containers. The data volume belonging to a container should be explicitly defined and administered. This is useful in many cases where the admin controls where they would want developers to write files and errors. Also, this has other advantages such as below:

      This leads to an immutable infrastructure
      Since the container instance cannot be written to, there is no need to audit instance divergence
      Reduced security attack vectors since the instance cannot be tampered with or written to
      Ability to use a purely volume based backup without backing up anything from theinstance</td></tr><tr><td>docker-5.14</td><td>Set the 'on-failure' container restart policy to 5</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>Using the '--restart' flag in 'docker run' command you can specify a restart policy for how a container should or should not be restarted on exit. You should choose the 'on-failure' restart policy and limit the restart attempts to 5.

  Rationale: If you indefinitely keep trying to start the container, it could possibly lead to a denial of service on the host. It could be an easy way to do a distributed denial of service attack especially if you have many containers on the same host. Additionally, ignoring the exit status of the container and 'always' attempting to restart the container leads to non-investigation of the root cause behind containers getting terminated. If a container gets terminated, you should investigate on the reason behind it instead of just attempting to restart it indefinitely. Thus, it is recommended to use 'on-failure' restart policy and limit it to maximum of 5 restart attempts.</td></tr><tr><td>docker-5.17</td><td>Do not directly expose host devices to containers</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>Host devices can be directly exposed to containers at runtime. Do not directly expose host devices to containers especially for containers that are not trusted.

  Rationale: The '--device' option exposes the host devices to the containers and consequently the containers can directly access such host devices. You would not require the container to run in 'privileged' mode to access and manipulate the host devices. By default, the container will be able to read, write and mknod these devices. Additionally, it is possible for containers to remove block devices from the host. Hence, do not expose host devices to containers directly. If at all, you would want to expose the host device to a container, use the sharing permissions appropriately:

      r - read only
      w - writable
      m - mknod allowed</td></tr><tr><td>docker-5.21</td><td>Do not disable default seccomp profile</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>Seccomp filtering provides a means for a process to specify a filter for incoming system calls. The default Docker seccomp profile disables 44 system calls, out of 313. It should not be disabled unless it hinders your container application usage.

  Rationale: A large number of system calls are exposed to every userland process with many of them going unused for the entire lifetime of the process. Most of the applications do not need all the system calls and thus benefit by having a reduced set of available system calls. The reduced set of system calls reduces the total kernel surface exposed to the application and thus improvises application security.</td></tr><tr><td>docker-5.25</td><td>Restrict container from acquiring additional privileges</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>Restrict the container from acquiring additional privileges via suid or sgid bits.

  Rationale: A process can set the no_new_priv bit in the kernel. It persists across fork, clone and execve. The no_new_priv bit ensures that the process or its children processes do not gain any additional privileges via suid or sgid bits. This way a lot of dangerous operations become a lot less dangerous because there is no possibility of subverting privileged binaries.</td></tr><tr><td>docker-5.26</td><td>Check container health at runtime</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>If the container image does not have an HEALTHCHECK instruction defined, use --health-cmd parameter at container runtime for checking container health.

  Rationale: One of the important security triads is availability. If the container image you are using does not have a pre-defined HEALTHCHECK instruction, use the --health-cmd parameter to check container health at runtime. Based on the reported health status, you could take necessary actions.</td></tr><tr><td>docker-5.31</td><td>Do not mount the Docker socket inside any containers</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>The docker socket (docker.sock) should not be mounted inside a container.

  Rationale: If the docker socket is mounted inside a container it would allow processes running within the container to execute docker commands which effectively allows for full control of the host.</td></tr><tr><td>docker-2.18</td><td>Disable Userland Proxy</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>The docker daemon starts a userland proxy service for port forwarding whenever a port is exposed. Where hairpin NAT is available, this service is generally superfluous to requirements and can be disabled.

  Rationale: Docker engine provides two mechanisms for forwarding ports from the host to containers, hairpin NAT, and a userland proxy. In most circumstances, the hairpin NAT mode is preferred as it improves performance and makes use of native Linux iptables functionality instead of an additional component. Where hairpin NAT is available, the userland proxy should be disabled on startup to reduce the attack surface of the installation.</td></tr><tr><td>docker-3.7</td><td>Verify that registry certificate file ownership is set to root:root</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>Verify that all the registry certificate files (usually found under /etc/docker/certs.d/<registry-name> directory) are owned and group-owned by 'root'.

  Rationale: /etc/docker/certs.d/<registry-name> directory contains Docker registry certificates. These certificate files must be owned and group-owned by 'root' to maintain the integrity of the certificates.</td></tr><tr><td>docker-3.8</td><td>Verify that registry certificate file permissions are set to 444 or more restrictive</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>Verify that all the registry certificate files (usually found under /etc/docker/certs.d/<registry-name> directory) have permissions of '444' or more restrictive.

  Rationale: /etc/docker/certs.d/<registry-name> directory contains Docker registry certificates. These certificate files must have permissions of '444' to maintain the integrity of the certificates.</td></tr><tr><td>docker-3.9</td><td>Verify that TLS CA certificate file ownership is set to root:root</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>Verify that the TLS CA certificate file (the file that is passed alongwith '--tlscacert' parameter) is owned and group-owned by 'root'.

  Rationale: The TLS CA certificate file should be protected from any tampering. It is used to authenticate Docker server based on given CA certificate. Hence, it must be owned and group-owned by 'root' to maintain the integrity of the CA certificate.</td></tr><tr><td>docker-3.10</td><td>Verify that TLS CA certificate file permissions are set to 444 or more restrictive</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>Verify that the TLS CA certificate file (the file that is passed alongwith '--tlscacert' parameter) has permissions of '444' or more restrictive.

  Rationale: The TLS CA certificate file should be protected from any tampering. It is used to authenticate Docker server based on given CA certificate. Hence, it must have permissions of '444' to maintain the integrity of the CA certificate.</td></tr><tr><td>docker-3.11</td><td>Verify that Docker server certificate file ownership is set to root:root</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>Verify that the Docker server certificate file (the file that is passed alongwith '--tlscert' parameter) is owned and group-owned by 'root'.

  Rationale: The Docker server certificate file should be protected from any tampering. It is used to authenticate Docker server based on the given server certificate. Hence, it must be owned and group-owned by 'root' to maintain the integrity of the certificate.</td></tr><tr><td>docker-3.12</td><td>Verify that Docker server certificate file permissions are set to 444 or more restrictive</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>Verify that the Docker server certificate file (the file that is passed alongwith '--tlscert' parameter) has permissions of '444' or more restrictive.

  Rationale: The Docker server certificate file should be protected from any tampering. It is used to authenticate Docker server based on the given server certificate. Hence, it must have permissions of '444' to maintain the integrity of the certificate.</td></tr><tr><td>docker-3.13</td><td>Verify that Docker server certificate key file ownership is set to root:root</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>Verify that the Docker server certificate key file (the file that is passed alongwith '--tlskey' parameter) is owned and group-owned by 'root'.

  Rationale: The Docker server certificate key file should be protected from any tampering or unneeded reads. It holds the private key for the Docker server certificate. Hence, it must be owned and group-owned by 'root' to maintain the integrity of the Docker server certificate.</td></tr><tr><td>docker-3.14</td><td>Verify that Docker server certificate key file permissions are set to 444 or more restrictive</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>Verify that the Docker server certificate key file (the file that is passed alongwith '--tlskey' parameter) has permissions of '400'.

  Rationale: The Docker server certificate key file should be protected from any tampering or unneeded reads. It holds the private key for the Docker server certificate. Hence, it must have permissions of '400' to maintain the integrity of the Docker server certificate.</td></tr><tr><td>docker-3.17</td><td>Verify that daemon.json file ownership is set to root:root</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>'daemon.json' file contains sensitive parameters that may alter the behavior of docker daemon. Hence, it should be owned and group-owned by 'root' to maintain the integrity of the file.

  Rationale: 'daemon.json' file contains sensitive parameters that may alter the behavior of docker daemon. Hence, it should be owned and group-owned by 'root' to maintain the integrity of the file.</td></tr><tr><td>docker-3.18</td><td>Verify that /etc/docker/daemon.json file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>'daemon.json' file contains sensitive parameters that may alter the behavior of docker daemon. Hence, it should be writable only by 'root' to maintain the integrity of the file.

  Rationale: 'daemon.json' file contains sensitive parameters that may alter the behavior of docker daemon. Hence, it should be writable only by 'root' to maintain the integrity of the file.</td></tr><tr><td>host-6.4</td><td>Avoid image sprawl</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>Do not keep a large number of container images on the same host. Use only tagged images as appropriate.

  Rationale: Tagged images are useful to fall back from "latest" to a specific version of an image in production. Images with unused or old tags may contain vulnerabilities that might be exploited, if instantiated. Additionally, if you fail to remove unused images from the system and there are various such redundant and unused images, the host filesystem may become full and could lead to denial of service.</td></tr><tr><td>host-1.1</td><td>Create a separate partition for containers</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>All Docker containers and their data and metadata is stored under /var/lib/docker directory. By default, /var/lib/docker would be mounted under / or /var partitions based on availability.

  Rationale: Docker depends on /var/lib/docker as the default directory where all Docker related files, including the images, are stored. This directory might fill up fast and soon Docker and the host could become unusable. So, it is advisable to create a separate partition (logical volume) for storing Docker files.</td></tr><tr><td>host-1.6</td><td>Only allow trusted users to control Docker daemon</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>The Docker daemon currently requires 'root' privileges. A user added to the 'docker' group gives him full 'root' access rights.

  Rationale: Docker allows you to share a directory between the Docker host and a guest container without limiting the access rights of the container. This means that you can start a container and map the / directory on your host to the container. The container will then be able to alter your host file system without any restrictions. In simple terms, it means that you can attain elevated privileges with just being a member of the 'docker' group and then starting a container with mapped / directory on the host.</td></tr><tr><td>host-1.7</td><td>Audit docker daemon</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>Audit all Docker daemon activities.

  Rationale: Apart from auditing your regular Linux file system and system calls, audit Docker daemon as well. Docker daemon runs with 'root' privileges. It is thus necessary to audit its activities and usage.</td></tr><tr><td>host-1.8</td><td>Audit Docker files and directories - /var/lib/docker</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>Audit /var/lib/docker.

  Rationale: Apart from auditing your regular Linux file system and system calls, audit all Docker related files and directories. Docker daemon runs with 'root' privileges. Its behavior depends on some key files and directories. /var/lib/docker is one such directory. It holds all the information about containers. It must be audited.</td></tr><tr><td>host-1.9</td><td>Audit Docker files and directories - /etc/docker</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>Audit /etc/docker.

  Rationale: Apart from auditing your regular Linux file system and system calls, audit all Docker related files and directories. Docker daemon runs with 'root' privileges. Its behavior depends on some key files and directories. /etc/docker is one such directory. It holds various certificates and keys used for TLS communication between Docker daemon and Docker client. It must be audited.</td></tr><tr><td>host-1.10</td><td>Audit Docker files and directories - docker.service</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>Audit docker.service, if applicable.

  Rationale: Apart from auditing your regular Linux file system and system calls, audit all Docker related files and directories. Docker daemon runs with 'root' privileges. Its behavior depends on some key files and directories. docker.service is one such file. The docker.service file might be present if the daemon parameters have been changed by an administrator. It holds various parameters for Docker daemon. It must be audited, if applicable.</td></tr><tr><td>host-1.11</td><td>Audit Docker files and directories - docker.socket</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>Audit docker.socket, if applicable.

  Rationale: Apart from auditing your regular Linux file system and system calls, audit all Docker related files and directories. Docker daemon runs with 'root' privileges. Its behavior depends on some key files and directories. docker.socket is one such file. It holds various parameters for Docker daemon socket. It must be audited, if applicable.</td></tr><tr><td>host-1.12</td><td>Audit Docker files and directories - /etc/default/docker</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>Audit /etc/default/docker , if applicable.

  Rationale: Apart from auditing your regular Linux file system and system calls, audit all Docker related files and directories. Docker daemon runs with 'root' privileges.

  Rationale: Apart from auditing your regular Linux file system and system calls, audit all Docker related files and directories. Docker daemon runs with 'root' privileges. Its behavior depends on some key files and directories. /usr/bin/docker-containerd is one such file. Docker now relies on containerd and runC to spawn containers. It must be audited, if applicable.</td></tr><tr><td>host-1.15</td><td>Audit Docker files and directories - /usr/bin/docker-runc</td><td><center>failed</center></td><td>Audit /usr/bin/docker-runc, if applicable.
